                   Here we see what could be labeled as "Visual Hierarchy". To explain this concept, where are your eyes drawn to when you first look at this screenshot above? Where do they go next? Visual Hierarchy used correctly practically dictates where our attention goes from one place to another on the screen. This is used here as we first notice and read the largest text on screen, and as it gets smaller the lower we go, so do our eyes follow the next line one after another.

                    Although the term "White Space" implies the color white, it is not a requirement to be white. However the meaning behind it is the useful lack of items or content. In other words, space. White space can be extremely useful when we don't want to overwhelm the user or completely subract from what should be the focus of our attention. "White space" is used here to point our attention to the artist, the song name, and main tools of the webpage such as pause or skip.

                    The Rule of Thirds is best seen or imagined as a three by three grid. (Think tic tak toe!) When taking a photo, if you were to line this grid up with the points intersecting on the main interest of the shot, or by lining up things such as a horizon upon the horizontal lines in the grid, you would be following the Rule of Thirds. When a photo is taken this way, it instantly allows us to take in the main points of the photo, and appreciate the impact that it can bring into view. This photo, though small, lines up with the grid by placing the woman's face at one intersection and her legs and the horizon of the terminal along the lines of the grid.
